Description: Simple TODO Web Application using Python Django
The TODO project is a web application designed to help users organize their tasks effectively. 
It provides a user-friendly interface where users can create, update, and delete tasks as needed. 
The main goal of the application is to streamline task management and improve productivity.

Key Features:
Task Creation: Users can easily add new tasks to their TODO list. Each task can include a title, description, due date, priority level, and any additional notes.
Task Management: The application allows users to view their tasks in a clear and organized manner. Tasks can be sorted by due date, priority, or completion status, making it easy to focus on the most urgent or important tasks first.
Task Updates: Users can edit existing tasks to make changes such as updating the title, description, due date, or priority level. They can also mark tasks as completed or delete tasks that are no longer needed.
User Authentication: To ensure security and privacy, the application requires users to create an account and log in before accessing their TODO list. User authentication helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive task information.

Technologies Used:
The TODO project is built using the following technologies:

Python Django: The web application framework used for backend development, including user authentication, data storage, and business logic implementation.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The frontend technologies used for designing the user interface and implementing interactive features.
SQLite Database: The lightweight and easy-to-use database management system used for storing task data.
Bootstrap Framework: The frontend framework used for creating responsive and mobile-friendly UI components.

To run the server: "python manage.py runserver"
